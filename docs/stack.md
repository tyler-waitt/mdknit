If you‚Äôre only developing a Markdown editor for macOS, and want maximum control with minimal abstraction in the spirit of Casey Muratori and friends, here‚Äôs what I‚Äôd recommend:

‚∏ª

ü•á Best Option: Cocoa + Objective-C++ (.mm) + C++ Core

üß± Structure:
- Use Cocoa (NSWindow, NSTextView, NSView, etc.) for the GUI.
- Write your core editor logic (markdown parsing, text buffer, file I/O) in pure C++.
- Bridge between Cocoa and C++ using Objective-C++ (.mm files can use both Objective-C and C++).

‚úÖ Why This Is Ideal:
- You get full native macOS look and feel.
- You avoid over-abstracted frameworks like Qt.
- You keep tight control over performance and data layout.
- You can write all your core logic in C++, and just use Cocoa to ‚Äúshow it.‚Äù

üß∞ Tools & Libraries

Component	Recommendation	Notes
GUI	Cocoa / AppKit	Use NSWindow, NSTextView, NSView, etc.
Markdown	Your own or cmark	Low-level C Markdown parser
Font/Text	NSTextView or custom text rendering	Cocoa gives you rich text control
Build	make + clang	You‚Äôll need .mm files for bridging
File I/O	C++ fstream or NSFileManager	C++ for shared logic is fine


‚∏ª

üß≠ Development Flow
	1.	Set up a Cocoa macOS app (Xcode or manually).
	2.	Create a .mm file for your GUI controller.
	3.	Build your text buffer, parser, etc. in C++ (.cpp/.h files).
	4.	Use Cocoa for:
- Menu bar
- File dialogs
- Window and input handling
- Rendering text (via NSTextView or custom NSView)

‚∏ª

‚ö†Ô∏è Caveats
- Cocoa uses reference-counted Objective-C objects, not C++ memory management, so you‚Äôll need to bridge carefully.
- If you go fully custom with NSView and draw everything manually (like Casey does in Handmade Hero), you‚Äôll write your own text layout + rendering, which is more work but gives full control.

‚∏ª

‚úÖ TL;DR Recommendation

If you want ease of development while keeping maximum clarity and control:
- Use Cocoa for the window and text view (NSTextView)
- Write all your editor logic in C++
- Bridge with Objective-C++
- Avoid third-party frameworks unless they solve a very specific need (e.g. use cmark if you want standards-compliant markdown)
